# Unhandled Firebase Authentication Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using Firebase Authentication.  The issue arises from unclear error messages returned when users provide invalid email addresses or weak passwords during the `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` process.  The provided code examples show the problem and a solution for handling these scenarios more gracefully.

## Problem

The standard Firebase error handling might not provide sufficient context when a user inputs an incorrectly formatted email address or an insecure password. This leads to a poor user experience and difficulties in debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves more robust error handling. By checking for common input errors *before* attempting authentication, and providing more user-friendly feedback based on specific Firebase error codes, the application can greatly improve the user experience and simplify debugging.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run the Javascript examples to see the problem and the improved solution.
