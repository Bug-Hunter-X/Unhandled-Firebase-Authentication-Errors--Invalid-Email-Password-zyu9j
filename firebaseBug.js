The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email address is not properly formatted or if the password does not meet the specified complexity requirements.  For example, a missing `@` symbol in the email or a password that's too short can lead to cryptic error messages that are difficult to debug.

```javascript
// Incorrect email format
firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(invalidEmail, password)
.catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
  // The error message might not clearly indicate the email format issue
});
```
